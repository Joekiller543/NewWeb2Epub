# AI Audit Report: NewWeb2Epub

## Executive Summary
The codebase represents a full-stack application (Monorepo) with a React frontend and a Node.js/Socket.IO backend. It is currently NOT ready for Netlify deployment. The frontend lacks the necessary redirect configuration for Single Page Application routing (causing 404s on refresh). More critically, the backend architecture relies on a persistent Node.js server with WebSockets, which cannot be hosted on Netlify's standard static hosting or Serverless Functions. The backend must be separated and deployed to a container-based host (e.g., Railway, Render, Fly.io), or the architecture must be refactored.

## Scores
- **Netlify Compatibility Score:** 45%
- **Deployment Ready:** No

## Detailed Findings

### 1. [NETLIFY] ERROR ❌
**File:** `client/public/_redirects`
**Observation:** Missing public/_redirects file or netlify.toml. React Router requires a rewrite rule (/* /index.html 200) to handle client-side routing on page refresh, otherwise accessing /novel directly returns a 404.

### 2. [NETLIFY] ERROR ❌
**File:** `server/src/index.js`
**Observation:** Architectural Incompatibility: The project contains a 'server' directory with a long-running Node.js process using Socket.IO. Netlify only supports static files and ephemeral serverless functions. This backend code will not run on Netlify and must be deployed elsewhere.

### 3. [LOGIC] WARNING ⚠️
**File:** `client/src/store/novelStore.js`
**Observation:** Hardcoded VITE_API_URL fallback. If the environment variable is missing in production, the client will attempt to connect to the relative path '' (the Netlify domain), where the backend does not exist.

### 4. [CSS] WARNING ⚠️
**File:** `client/src/pages/Home.jsx`
**Observation:** Usage of '100vh' in layout styles. On mobile browsers with dynamic address bars, this can cause layout shifting or cut-off content. Recommended to use '100dvh' (dynamic viewport height) for full-screen containers.

### 5. [SECURITY] INFO ℹ️
**File:** `client/vite.config.js`
**Observation:** Vite proxy configuration is present but only applies to local development. Ensure the production build connects to the live backend URL.
